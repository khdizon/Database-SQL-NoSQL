    "In this phase of your PDA you will make sure your relations have keys and foreign keys, create a substantial amount of data for you databases, and load your database with this data using the MySQL \"load\" command.\n",

    "- First, make sure that your relations have keys and that the relations created from ER model relationships use foreign keys to specify the keys of the relations you are referencing.\n",
    "- To create the data, either\n",
    "    * write a program in any programming language you like that creates large files of records in a format acceptable to the load command, then load the data into your PDA relations.\n",
    "    * OR -- if using real data for your PDA, your program will need to transform the data into files of records conforming to your PDA schema.\n",
    "    * OR -- use an application such as Mockaroo to fabricate data. Generate either random or nonrandom (e.g., sequential) records conforming to your schema. It is both fine and expected for your data values—strings especially—to be meaningless gibberish. The point of generating large amounts of data is so that you can experiment with a database of realistic size. \n",
    "    \n",
    "The data you generate, and load should be on the order of\n",
    "- At least one table (relation) with tens of thousands of rows (tuples)\n",
    "- At least two additional tables (relations) with thousands of rows (tuples)\n",
    "\n",
    "When writing a program to fabricate data, keep in mind the following two points:\n",
    "1. Make sure you do not generate duplicate values for attributes that serve as keys. \n",
    "2. Your PDA almost certainly includes relations that are expected to join with each other. For example, you may have a STUDENT relation with attribute courseNo that's expected to join with attribute number in relation COURSES. In generating data, be sure to generate values that actually do join—otherwise, all of your interesting queries will have empty results! One way to guarantee join-ability is to generate the values in one relation, then use the generated values in one relation to select joining values for the other relation. For example, you could generate course numbers first (either sequentially or randomly), then use these numbers to fill in the courseNo values in the STUDENT relation.\n",
